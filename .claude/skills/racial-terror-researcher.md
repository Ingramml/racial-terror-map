---

## Search Strategy Framework

### Step 1: Incident Identification

**Start with known incident lists:**
1. Check existing datasets (Wikipedia, EJI, Racial Violence Archive)
2. Identify: Location, approximate date, incident type
3. Note key figures: victims, perpetrators, locations

### Step 2: Newspaper Search Terms

**Effective search queries:**

**For specific incidents:**
```
"[City Name]" AND "riot" AND [Year]
"[Church/Building Name]" AND "bombing"
"[Victim Name]" AND "lynching"
```

**For discovery research:**
```
"Negro" AND "mob" AND [City] (historical term usage)
"colored" AND "violence" AND [State]
"race riot" AND [Year range]
"church bombing" AND [City]
"massacre" AND "Black" AND [Location]
```

**Black Press searches (often more accurate):**
```
"racial terrorism" AND [Location]
"white mob" AND [City]
"lynched" AND [County]
```

### Step 3: Cross-Reference Sources

**Verify details across multiple sources:**
- [ ] White mainstream press (often underreported deaths)
- [ ] Black press (more accurate casualty counts)
- [ ] Academic historical analysis
- [ ] Government records (if available)

**Note discrepancies:**
- Official death toll vs. estimated toll
- Contemporary reports vs. historical analysis
- Perpetrator identification (often protected by police)

### Step 4: Data Extraction

**Key information to collect:**

**Essential Fields:**
- [ ] Event name/description
- [ ] Date (exact or approximate)
- [ ] City, State
- [ ] Latitude/Longitude (use geocoding tools)
- [ ] Official death toll
- [ ] Estimated/actual death toll (if different)
- [ ] Number injured
- [ ] Type (massacre, riot, bombing, lynching, arson)

**Contextual Fields:**
- [ ] Narrative (2-3 sentence summary)
- [ ] Trigger/cause
- [ ] Perpetrators (KKK, white mob, police, etc.)
- [ ] Victims (demographic info)
- [ ] Property destroyed
- [ ] Legal outcome (arrests, convictions)
- [ ] Reference URLs

## Research Workflow Example

### Example: Researching a Church Bombing in Birmingham, 1963

**Step 1: Initial Search**
```
Query: "Birmingham" AND "church" AND "bombing" AND "1963"
Sources: Chronicling America, Chicago Defender, NYT Archive
```

**Step 2: Identify Primary Sources**
- Find original newspaper reports from September 1963
- Locate NAACP Crisis Magazine coverage
- Check FBI records (available via archives)

**Step 3: Extract Details**
```
Name: 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing
Date: September 15, 1963
Location: Birmingham, Alabama
Coordinates: 33.5158° N, 86.8147° W
Deaths: 4 (Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley)
Injured: 22
Type: Bombing, Church
Perpetrators: KKK members (Robert Chambliss, Thomas Blanton, Bobby Cherry, Herman Cash)
```

**Step 4: Write Narrative**
```
On September 15, 1963, members of the Ku Klux Klan planted dynamite beneath
the steps of the 16th Street Baptist Church. The explosion killed four young
Black girls attending Sunday school and injured 22 others. The bombing galvanized
the Civil Rights Movement and led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
```

**Step 5: Cross-Reference**
- Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing
- FBI Records: https://vault.fbi.gov/16th-street-baptist-church-bombing
- EJI: https://eji.org/news/history-racial-injustice-birmingham-church-bombing/

## Advanced Research Techniques

### 1. Discovering Unknown Incidents

**Use aggregated incident lists as starting points:**
- EJI's county-by-county lynching reports
- Wikipedia's list of race riots
- Academic books with appendices (e.g., "The Blood of Emmett Till")

**Scan regional newspapers for patterns:**
- Search "[State]" AND "racial violence" by decade
- Look for "race trouble" (euphemism in white press)
- Check Black press for "mob violence" reports

### 2. Handling Incomplete Records

**When official records are missing:**
- Check Black press (often more complete)
- Look for NAACP field reports
- Search academic dissertations on local history
- Contact local historical societies

**Death toll discrepancies:**
- Official toll: Usually from white authorities (undercount)
- Black press estimates: Often higher, more accurate
- Academic consensus: Use footnotes to find sources
- **Best practice:** Record both official and estimated tolls

### 3. Geographic Precision

**Getting accurate coordinates:**
- Use Google Maps for modern addresses
- Historical buildings: Check National Register of Historic Places
- Churches: Search church name + city in Google Maps
- Demolished sites: Use historical maps or city directories

**Tools:**
- https://www.latlong.net/ (quick geocoding)
- Google Maps (right-click → "What's here?")
- OpenStreetMap (historical features sometimes preserved)

## Source Evaluation Checklist

**Assessing reliability:**

- [ ] **Primary source?** (newspaper from the time vs. later analysis)
- [ ] **Author bias?** (white mainstream vs. Black press perspective)
- [ ] **Corroboration?** (Do multiple sources confirm details?)
- [ ] **Official vs. actual?** (Government records often minimize Black deaths)
- [ ] **Perpetrator accountability?** (Were arrests made? Convictions?)

**Red flags for unreliable sources:**
- Wikipedia without citations
- Single-source claims (especially death tolls)
- Rounded numbers without explanation (e.g., "about 100 dead")
- Racist language without historical context

## Common Research Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User provides a city and year
**Example:** "Research racial violence in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921"

**Workflow:**
1. Search Chronicling America for "Tulsa" AND "riot" AND "1921"
2. Search Chicago Defender archives
3. Check EJI database for Oklahoma incidents
4. Cross-reference with Wikipedia's Tulsa Race Massacre article
5. Extract details and format as GeoJSON

### Scenario 2: User wants to expand church bombing data
**Example:** "Find more church bombings in Birmingham during the 1960s"

**Workflow:**
1. Search "Birmingham" AND "church" AND "bombing" AND "1960-1969"
2. Check FBI church bombing files
3. Search Chicago Defender for "Dynamite Hill" (nickname for Birmingham area)
4. Cross-reference with academic sources on Birmingham civil rights history
5. Map all incidents with coordinates

### Scenario 3: Verifying existing data
**Example:** "The map says 120 died in the NYC Draft Riot - is that accurate?"

**Workflow:**
1. Search scholarly sources for NYC Draft Riot death toll
2. Compare official records vs. historical analysis
3. Note range (e.g., "official: 120, estimated: 300+")
4. Update dataset with footnote about discrepancy

## Ethical Considerations

**When researching racial violence:**

1. **Centering Black voices:**
   - Prioritize Black press and scholarship
   - Include victim names when known and appropriate
   - Avoid sensationalizing violence

2. **Accurate terminology:**
   - Use "racial terrorism" not "race riot" when white mobs attacked Black communities
   - Use "massacre" for one-sided mass killings
   - Avoid euphemisms like "racial disturbance"

3. **Acknowledging gaps:**
   - Many incidents were never documented
   - Black deaths often uncounted or minimized
   - Perpetrators rarely prosecuted

4. **Respecting descendants:**
   - This is recent history - many survivors and descendants are living
   - Treat victims with dignity
   - Acknowledge ongoing impact of racial terror
